/**
 * Tiny client-side SWR cache for team-management drill-ins. Keyed by team
 * id; entries hold the three lazy-fetched payloads plus the timestamp at

 * immediately and kicks off a background refetch when the entry is older
 * than `FRESH_WINDOW_MS`.
 *
 * Module-level state is intentional — the cache is a per-tab session
 * accelerator, not durable storage. It clears automatically on full
 * reload (module re-eval) and on tab close.
