/**
 * Resolve the latest `updated_at` across every project the supplied user
 * can access, plus every task and edge belonging to those projects. Used as
 * the conditional-GET validator on `GET /api/projects` so the home grid
 * receives a 304 when nothing in the user's accessible scope has moved.
 *
 * Single round-trip via `GREATEST` over per-table aggregates. The user's
 * accessibility is enforced by the `member` join — the raw helper does no
 * separate auth check, so callers must supply a verified user id.
 *
 * @param conn - Drizzle client or transaction handle.
 * @param userId - Verified user id.
 * @returns The latest `updated_at`, or epoch-0 when the user has no
 *   accessible projects (so a missing-data response still has a stable
 *   validator the client can revalidate against).
