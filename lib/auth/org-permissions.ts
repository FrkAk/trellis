 * Check whether the caller can administer the named team. Delegates to
 * Better Auth's `/organization/has-permission` API, which reads the
 * caller's role from `neon_auth.member` for the supplied `organizationId`
 * and consults the active access-control policy. Returns `false` (never
 * throws) so callers can collapse the result into a typed `forbidden`
 * failure.
 *
 * Probes `invitation:create` — both `owner` and `admin` hold this by
 * default; plain `member` does not. Compatible with the custom roles
 * configured via the organization plugin's `roles` option (MYMR-69) since
 * those preserve `invitation:create` in the admin/owner statements.
 *
 * Non-members of the supplied team surface as `false` — BA throws
 * `USER_IS_NOT_A_MEMBER_OF_THE_ORGANIZATION` which is caught here. So
 * callers can safely pass an arbitrary `organizationId` from a request
 * body — the check is properly scoped to the target team.
 *
 * @param organizationId - Target team UUID. Required: the team scope is
 *   never inferred from the caller's session.
 * @returns True when the caller may invite/cancel/update against the target team.
