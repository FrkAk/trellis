-- Hand-written RLS policies for public.*. Drizzle's `pgPolicy()` round-trip
-- drops USING/WITH CHECK on push, so policy DDL lives here.
--
-- Membership is computed once per query via `public.current_user_org_ids()`,
-- a STABLE SECURITY DEFINER function returning `uuid[]`. The membership
-- predicates use `IN (SELECT unnest(public.current_user_org_ids()))` — an
-- explicit sublink that forces an InitPlan node regardless of planner
-- heuristics on STABLE-function memoization. 2- and 3-hop tables delegate
-- through the parent table's RLS rather than duplicating the membership
-- join, so adding new auth schema columns doesn't ripple here.
--
-- `task_edges` USING and WITH CHECK both require both endpoints visible.
-- USING-side symmetry matters because Postgres does not evaluate WITH CHECK
-- on DELETE; without it, a source-side member could delete (or read) an
-- edge whose target lives in a foreign team.

-- projects — 1-hop directly on organization_id. The `IN (SELECT unnest(...))`
-- form materializes the membership array once via an InitPlan node so the
-- per-row check is a constant-time set probe.

-- the OR of permissive policies. Even if a future engineer adds another
-- permissive write policy (intentionally or otherwise), this floor still
-- requires admin/owner for any INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on team_invite_code —
-- it cannot be OR-relaxed by adding more permissives. Scoped per-command
