-- =============================================================================
-- Canonical GRANT/REVOKE for the three-role split (app_user, service_role,
-- auth_role). Single source of truth — consumed by:
--   * docker/init-rls.sh                       (self-host bootstrap, `\i`)
--   * tests/setup/migrate.ts                   (testcontainer, readFileSync)
--   * docs/neon-prod-provisioning.sql          (Neon prod runbook, pointer)
--
-- Scope: schema/table/sequence grants and default privileges only.
-- Out of scope here (kept in each consumer because they vary per context):
--   * CREATE ROLE — passwords flow from env / Neon console / test fixture
--   * GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE "<db>" — DB name varies (POSTGRES_DB / neondb)
--   * CREATE SCHEMA drizzle — only needed when `drizzle-kit migrate` runs
--     (self-host + Neon prod). Testcontainer uses `drizzle-kit push` which
--     does not provision the migrations schema.
--
-- Idempotent. Safe to re-run.
