-- =============================================================================
-- Canonical GRANT/REVOKE for the three-role split (app_user, service_role,
-- auth_role). Single source of truth — consumed by:
--   * docker/init-rls.sh                       (self-host bootstrap, `\i`)
--   * tests/setup/migrate.ts                   (testcontainer, readFileSync)
--   * docs/neon-prod-provisioning.sql          (Neon prod runbook, pointer)
--
-- Scope: schema/table/sequence grants and default privileges only.
-- Out of scope here (kept in each consumer because they vary per context):
--   * CREATE ROLE — passwords flow from env / Neon console / test fixture
--   * GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE "<db>" — DB name varies (POSTGRES_DB / neondb)
--   * CREATE SCHEMA drizzle — only needed when `drizzle-kit migrate` runs
--     (self-host + Neon prod). Testcontainer uses `drizzle-kit push` which
--     does not provision the migrations schema.
--
-- Idempotent. Safe to re-run.

-- CVE-2018-1058 hardening note: TEMPORARY privilege on the database is
-- revoked from PUBLIC. Because REVOKE TEMPORARY requires a concrete
-- database name (no function-call form), the statement lives in two
-- context-aware locations rather than this file:
--   * docker/init-rls.sh             (self-host / testcontainer)
--   * docs/neon-prod-provisioning.sql section 8 (Neon prod runbook)

-- public schema: app_user runs every query under RLS; service_role bypasses.
--
-- No `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` on the public schema. Default privileges
-- would auto-grant DML on any future table at CREATE TIME, BEFORE the
-- migration has had a chance to `ALTER TABLE … ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`
-- + attach policies. A new table would be reachable from app_user with no
-- RLS protection for the window between CREATE TABLE and ENABLE RLS — a
-- stealth data leak.
--
-- New public tables MUST receive explicit grants in their migration:
--   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON <table> TO app_user, service_role;
--   GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON <table>_id_seq TO app_user, service_role;  -- if applicable
-- The `rls-coverage.test.ts` invariant catches a missing RLS attach. A
-- missing grant is a LOUD failure (queries error on first hit), not a
-- stealth failure, so the trade is asymmetric in our favor.
--
-- KEEP IN SYNC WITH docs/neon-prod-provisioning.sql.
