# Provision RLS-aware roles for self-hosted Postgres so a fresh clone
# exercises real RLS and matches Neon production parity. Idempotent —
# safe to re-run on existing databases.
#
# Three-role structure (mirrors Neon prod):
#   * mymir (Docker POSTGRES_USER, container superuser) — DB owner, used for
#     bootstrap and human admin via psql. Equivalent of Neon `neondb_owner`.
#     NOT used by the app at runtime.
#   * service_role — BYPASSRLS + CREATE on schema public, used by:
#       - `drizzle-kit push` migration runner (via DATABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_URL)
#       - the documented runtime bypass call sites — see
#         `lib/db/connection.ts` for the canonical inventory. The
#         team-invite-code helpers (lookup/reserve/release) do NOT use
#         service_role; they run via SECURITY DEFINER functions exposed
#         to app_user.
#   * app_user — NO BYPASSRLS, the runtime role for the Next.js app
#     (via DATABASE_URL). RLS policies fire on every query.
#
# Passwords flow in from docker-compose's environment block.
